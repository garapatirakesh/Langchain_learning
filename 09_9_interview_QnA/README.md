# 🎓 AI & Agentic Workflows: Interview Mastery

This module is your final study guide for everything covered in the learning repository. It transforms technical implementation details into **100 "Real-World" Interview Questions**.

## 📂 Contents

- **[100_INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS.md](./100_INTERVIEW_QUESTIONS.md)**: LangChain, LangGraph, and Repository Patterns.
- **[200_LLM_ARCHITECTURE_QUESTIONS.md](./200_LLM_ARCHITECTURE_QUESTIONS.md)**: Theory, Training, Quantization, and Performance.
- **[150_ADV_AGENTS_MLOPS_EVALS.md](./150_ADV_AGENTS_MLOPS_EVALS.md)**: MLOps, Advanced RAG, Evals, Deployment, and Security.

## 📖 How to Use This Module

Every question in the document is structured with three parts:

1.  **Q (Question)**: The complex query you might face in a Senior AI Engineer interview.
2.  **A (Answer)**: A professional, plain-English explanation of the concept.
3.  **Ref (Reference)**: The exact module and script in this project where that concept is implemented.

### **Study Strategy:**
- **Step 1**: Read the question and try to answer it in your own words.
- **Step 2**: Read the provided answer to refine your understanding.
- **Step 3**: Open the **Ref** file (e.g., `02_langgraph_agents/04_persistence.py`) to see how that concept actually looks in code.

## 🧠 Core Pillar Categories

The questions cover the 5 pillars of modern AI development:
1.  **Utilities & Cost**: Tokenization, Caching, and LiteLLM.
2.  **LangChain Core**: Chains, Memory, and Tools.
3.  **LangGraph**: State, Persistence, and Human-in-the-loop.
4.  **Agent Patterns**: Reflection, Planning, and Multi-Agent Orchestration.
5.  **Production Readiness**: RAG, Safety (Guardrails), and DeepAgent Frameworks.
