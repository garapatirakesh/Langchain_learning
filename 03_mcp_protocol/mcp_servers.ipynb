    "# Model Context Protocol (MCP) - A Guide for Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI models (like Claude, GPT-4) to safely interact with local and remote resources. Think of it as a \"USB-C for AI apps\"—a standard way to connect LLMs to data sources and tools without building custom integrations for every new model or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why learn MCP?\n",
    "- **Standardization**: Build a tool once, works with any MCP-compliant client (Claude Desktop, IDEs like Cursor/Windsurf, etc.).\n",
    "- **Security**: Explicit permissions model.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Expose local files, databases, or API endpoints as \"Resources\" or \"Tools\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "1. **MCP Server**: The program that exposes capabilities (tools, resources, prompts).\n",
    "2. **MCP Client**: The application that consumes these capabilities (e.g., Claude Desktop, specific IDE extensions).\n",
    "3. **Resources**: Data that can be read by the LLM (like files, database rows).\n",
    "4. **Tools**: Functions that the LLM can execute (like `calculate_sum`, `fetch_weather`).\n",
    "5. **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates for interaction.\n",
