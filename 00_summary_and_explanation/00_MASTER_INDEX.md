## 🔑 Universal Rules (Apply to All Modules)

1. **Always validate inputs** - Never trust user input blindly
2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Expect things to fail
3. **Keep state minimal** - Only track what you need
4. **Make prompts clear** - Be specific and unambiguous
5. **Test thoroughly** - Verify behavior before deployment
6. **Monitor in production** - Track performance and errors
7. **Version your prompts** - Treat prompts like code
8. **Document your decisions** - Explain why, not just what
