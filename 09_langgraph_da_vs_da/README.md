# 09 LangGraph Deep Agent (DA) vs. DeepAgents Library (DA)

This folder contains a comprehensive comparison between the two approaches to building "Deep Agents" within the LangGraph ecosystem.

## 📁 Contents

- **[COMPARISON.md](./COMPARISON.md)**: A detailed breakdown of implementation, architecture, and "When to use what" for:
    - Manual LangGraph Patterns (found in `09_deep_agents`)
    - The `deepagents` Python Library (found in `09_langgraph_deep_agents`)

## 🎯 Purpose

As you advance in AI Agent development, you will encounter two ways to build complex systems. One is building from scratch for maximum flexibility, and the other is using high-level frameworks for speed and reliability. This module helps you choose the right path for your specific project.
